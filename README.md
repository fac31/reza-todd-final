## About

Meet RADAR, your newest travel companion. RADAR allows you to search any location in the world and receive up-to-date live information. 

The project is aimed at a customer base who are travelling or looking to travel and require a holistic overview of a location so that they can pack accordingly, gain an insight, and be prepared for their visit.

## Full-Stack Project

A final project to display our full-stack learning over the course of our studies with Founders and Coders. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express.

## What we learned

- How to create an appealing user interface.
- Expanding knowledge in front end javascript through text rotation, pop-up information, image carousels.
- Demonstrating information in a dynamic way.
- Using several API's to provide a holistic application.
